# How to Prepare for the BlackJack Hands-On-Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will build and deploy a blackjack RESTful
Cloud Application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service, using
Oracle Developer Cloud Service. The sample application is a blackjack
REST service with an HTML5 client. You will start by building a simple
Helloworld application using Git and Maven locally and push the
application to Oracle Developer Cloud Service. Next, you will deploy the
application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.

The result is you will learn to take an application developed locally
and deploy it to Oracle Cloud.

You must use your Oracle Cloud trial account to perform the lab and run
the blackjack card game.

## First, Get an Oracle Cloud Account

-   Prior to arriving at the event, you must obtain access to your own
    Trial account. Trial accounts can be obtained at [*Try
    It*](http://cloud.oracle.com/tryit)

## Second, Configure your Client Environment

1.  Your client environment **must be configured prior** to attempting
    the Hands-on-labs.

    -   You must download and create a local development environment on
        your personal device to setup a Git and Maven environment so
        that you can clone this to your Oracle Developer Cloud Service
        instance.  
            a. Download Netbeans or your favorite browser  
            b. Git  
            c. Maven  
            d. JDK 8

2.  Both **Option 1 and 2 are documented** in the Lab Guide. ***Please
    follow the instruction in the Lab Guide*** prior to attempting
    the Labs.

## How to View the Lab Guides

-   Download the blackjack.zip file from &lt;include url here&gt;
-   To log issues and view the Lab Guide source, go to the [oracle git repository](https://github.com/oracle/cloud-native-devops-workshop).

**Reference the following Lab Guides by opening the lab files:**
