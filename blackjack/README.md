# How to Prepare for the BlackJack Hands-On-Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will build and deploy a blackjack RESTful
Cloud Application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service, using
Oracle Developer Cloud Service. The sample application is a blackjack
REST service with an HTML5 client. You will start by building a simple
Helloworld application using Git and Maven locally and push the
application to Oracle Developer Cloud Service. Next, you will deploy the
application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.

The result is you will learn to take an application developed locally
and deploy it to Oracle Cloud.

You use your laptop and your Oracle Cloud trial account to perform the lab and run the blackjack card game.

## First, Get an Oracle Cloud Account

-   Prior to arriving at the event, please obtain access to your own Trial account. Trial accounts can be obtained at [Try
    It](http://cloud.oracle.com/tryit)

## Second, Configure your Client Environment

1. Your computerâ€™s environment must be configured prior to attempting the Hands-on-labs.

Please follow the instruction in the linked documents [Windows](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/OracleCode/Windows-HOL-setup.pdf) or [Mac](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/OracleCode/Mac-HOL-setup.pdf) of the Lab Guides prior to attempting the Labs.

2. Download the following files from GitHub (they are in the list on [this page](https://github.com/oracle/cloud-native-devops-workshop/tree/master/blackjack))
-   Blackjack.zip
-   Helloworld-Example.zip
-   pom.xml
